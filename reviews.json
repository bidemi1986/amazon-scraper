        "text": "EXTREMELY EASY TO USE \u2022 COST-EFFECTIVE \u2022 VERSATILE \u2022 SATISFYING: I happened to buy a 4-pack of Kasa smart plugs recently. After experiencing firsthand how easy it was to integrate them into my existing and very average home Wi-Fi system - not to mention tie their control into existing Amazon smart devices such as my Echo Dot and EchoPop - I simply couldn't resist the urge to (join the rest of you in the 21st century and) purchase a camera.\n\nAPPLICATION: I wanted an easy to buy, implement, use and maintain a remote controllable and reasonably 'smart' surveillance system - just to keep an eye on things that happen on the street. I learned very quickly the Kasa camera system has features that enable it to not only track motion but specifically people when desired (see Activity Zones IMG) ; features include various levels of tracking up to and including \"Patrol Mode\" which will cause the camera to rotate through the four savable \"scenes\" at the specified interval(s) allowing for 360\u00b0 monitoring from just one camera. Even has NIGHT VISION.\n\nI actually bought two cameras and haven't even set up the second one because the first is already doing so much!\n\nTIPS & TRICKS: Make sure you purchase a reasonable quality 64 GB mini SD card. That is the maximum size card this model of Kasa camera can utilize. TO INSERT THE CARD: using the mobile interface pan the camera upward until the mini SD card port and reset buttons are exposed (see IMGs.) Insert the card LABEL UP and press until firmly clicked and secured in its final position. I have been running the camera \"24/7\" (the actual mode is known as \"24/7 Monitoring\") at maximum resolution of 1080p for ~ 3 days and have used less than 25% of the 64 GB capacity. (see IMGs)\n\nHOW TO SAVE EVIDENCE: Should something unfortunate occur and you find yourself in the position of needing to save that which your camera captured you can simply click on \"24/7 recording\" & move the saved timeline bar to the requisite point, wait for playback to start and click the \ud83d\udd34 in the lower right-hand portion on the playback screen. (Note: Give the video recall some time - after all it is the camera having to go back and read saved data while still recording and saving new data, transmit saved data through the Wi-Fi network to your phone and ultimately save it in a new location. Even the fastest systems will take a moment.) Following these steps will save a video of what was recorded that you will find in your video gallery. *There is a portion of the app allocated to Activity Alerts Tracking which is available with a Kasa Care subscription; I do not have that subscription thus I am unable to speak to those features at this time but imagine they facilitate easier activity recall and saving.\n\nWHAT TO DO NOW: Click purchase. \ud83d\ude0a Seriously this thing is fabulous especially for the price point. Off the top of my head some of the easiest applications I can think of would be keeping an eye on your pets or your kids while they're at home or having an extra pair of eyes when needed.\n\n*** Keep in mind this review is written from the standpoint of someone seeking easy applications and easy use - If you are looking for something that is sturdy, has own/redundant power, data storage and signaling capacity, is designed to survive not only adverse weather/climate but also potential tampering this is not the device I would recommend."

        "text": "Tried a WYZE v4 first but turns out it was about as useful a camera as a brick would be.\n\nIt would NOT connect to my WIFI from either of my routers(I have a Xfinity modem/router but it's old so I bought a Netgear Nighthawk some years ago to boost the signal at a one time cost rather than renting extra equipment every month from Xfinity cause they refuse to replace anything that's outdated), it would NOT get detected by the WYZE app whether I used the same wifi signal or not so I couldn't even troubleshoot it since the app didn't know it existed in the first place. To make matters worse it costs $45 which is the most expensive brick I ever owned in my life so I returned it for a full refund and decided to try 1 more time with a cheaper but comparable camera. That's when I picked this up.\n\nI went in a skeptic assuming I would have the same problems as I always did with WYZE(tried a v3 or maybe v2 years ago, same problem as the v4 so I guess WYZE is just incapable of actual improvement and favors dumb gimmicks instead. The only thing that changed was the app layout which admittedly LOOKS better now but looks can be deceiving...)\n\nTurns out I was wrong and NOT every camera on Amazon is an overpriced pile of junk! This camera is half the price, connected immediately with 0 delays and functions exactly as advertised. This cameras App has performed nearly perfectly and I can even move this camera FAR from my router without any impact on the signal quality. I can keep my phone on 5G and STILL use EVERY feature on the app. I can also be far away from my router, house, and this camera without losing any features. That means I can get notified of activities, pan/tilt manually, toggle NV, change app settings/schedules, set up to 4 viewpoints, set detection zones in said viewpoints, record manually, turn the status LED on/off, download recorded activities(manual recordings OR detection-based recordings) and Etc...\n\nThe cloud service is cheap but in a GOOD way. Only $3/month per device(up to 4) or $10/month for up to 10 devices which is extremely affordable.\n\nThe quality of videos is very good IMO although I do wish the Frame rate was a little higher(I don't KNOW the exact Frame Rate but I'm a big time Gamer who just loves loves LOVES to toggle his FPS display ON and set it to high accuracy mode.) Based on what I have seen so far I think it's about 10-15 FPS so really fast movements will look like a smudge but natural movements shouldn't have that problem. It might not be the BEST option for monitoring(I don't know WHAT is cause this is only my 3rd attempt at finding a decent camera for basic monitoring but it's gone above and beyond my expectations at this pricepoint.) I'm actually about to get 2 or 3 more of these once I finish and submit my updated review.\n\nSome notes:\nWhen you plug it in for the first time it will probably start moving suddenly on it's own, this is NORMAL. It's a way to test the motor and range of motion for the pan/tilt feature and can be done manually in the app as well. I've moved to different outlets twice now and it has not done that on it's own either time leading me to believe it's only a one-time automated check up of sorts.\n\nBy coincidence, I found one minor flaw on the app which I'm not sure was a fluke or an actual Bug. I was watching a live video feed and tried to manually record something I wasn't sure would trigger motion detection but apparently it DID and my fool self forgot about the minor delay so it popped up in my notification panel \"Activity detected on ___\" but did not appear in the app right away so I refreshed it. When I went to reciew download it"

        "text": "To clarify, this is NOT a bad camera. Quite the opposite, as a matter of fact. I have the same camera, just the slightly \"cheaper\" version. When I say, \"cheaper\" I don't mean cheap. I just mean it costs less. I would not classify either version as cheap. If this review were for the \"basic\" model, it would have five stars. The reason for this model receiving just 3 of 5 possible stars is because there is an option for the camera to pan and tilt. It has motion detection and will automatically patrol if you choose it to do so. These functionalities all work fine and as expected. The motion sensing is actually pretty great and from an upstairs window it will catch people walking all the way across the street, which is much farther than the advertised 30 foot distance. The night vision works, but not through a window.\n\nI've never had any connection problems after having gotten it initially setup. That was kind of a pain, in all honesty. You wouldn't think it, but manually scrolling the camera to point upwards just to reach the reset button or to access the SD card is a poor design choice, in my opinion. The fact that's where the reset connection button is also makes it annoying, because you press and hold the button for it to begin doing its thing, searching for networks and devices and whatnot. Sometimes it will find the network and everything you're looking for right away, but other times it gives you the most confusing run around until you've disconnected and restarted the camera about a dozen times.\n\nThat being said, once you get the camera connected to your network and through the app, it works pretty flawlessly. It does load a little bit slow, so if you get a notification and open it up live, the motion that it caught may have already come and gone, but you can always revert to the 24/7 recording function and search through the recording history with footnotes that will take you right to the motion or object detection. Say a person walks by, it will save a bookmark for person detected. With a 256gb SD card, my camera tends to hold about 2-3 weeks worth of footage and I record 24/7.\n\nI used the motion tracking feature for a little while after I first got the camera so that I could follow people to see which direction they've gone after they pass my apartment. I have my parking space right in front of my unit, but someone still slashed the tires one night, hence the camera. It's a great feature, but I have a lot of car and foot traffic in front of my house that caused the camera to be panning left and right far too often. I didn't want to overwork it, so I turned it off. I don't think this is a quality issue here, but a motor/gear issue within the camera body itself that controls the panning and tilting functions that sound like they'll get pretty tired pretty soon if there's a lot of motion tracking. It doesn't sound terrible and it's only as loud as a very small fraction of a vibrating phone when it turns, but in a quiet room and it's tracking people in the early morning it's enough for you to want it to stop. But it's as easy as opening the settings and turning off motion tracking, but it will still record. If you have constant patrol or motion tracking, it's likely to run out of motor power sooner than later. I didn't want to put it to the test, because you can set \"viewpoints\" to your devices. I set up three viewpoints to cover my parking space and vehicle. I have a viewpoint to the left, with my vehicle on the right side of the frame. I have a second viewpoint that points directly at my vehicle, dead center in the parking space, and I have another viewpoint that keeps my vehicle in the left side of the frame. I can view a large swath of the street in front of my house and my neighbors feel better knowing I have a decent camera, because we all know that our complexes security cameras suck and point at nothing of importance.\n\nSo, to hit the algorithm for the cameras durability - I don't think they're waterproof, I wouldn't want to drop it, it is made out of cheap plastic after all, but I've never had any lens issues so far. My biggest worry about it's long-term durability would be focused mostly on the gears and motor that turns and pans the camera.\n\nWithin the My Kasa app, you can open it and it will display your list of devices, assuming you have multiple. If it's just a single device, it will show just the one device. You can select your device and it will pull up its real-time live feed. There is a microphone and audio settings on it, so if it's inside you can talk to your dog or whatever, you can hear your dog bark etc.\n\nMy other issue with this camera, and this is specifically about the white version of the camera that supposedly has a higher quality of video (something I could not tell the difference between, I'll explain here shortly) is the fact that when it does go through motion tracking or any sort of panning, it will return to its original viewpoint. That would be fine, having my vehicle dead center, but the viewpoint tells itself that the real viewpoint is several degrees off and is often pointing a bit higher than you originally had the viewpoint set. This leads you to having to reset the pan/tilt of the device almost every time it's done tracking motion.\n\nNow the difference in definition and quality, for me, was negligible, at best. Neither of the cameras could clearly read my license plate, so there was no difference in resolution quality there. I think the white version is supposed to be running a higher quality camera, but I think it's built off of the basic materials still used in the base model, which causes it to have a lag, slight delay, and it takes longer to load in the app. If anything, the higher \"quality\" is actually reduced because I don't think the hardware can withstand the power of the software and the lens capabilities.\n\nLong story short, get the base model for $20 and you won't be happier. Beats a $100 Ring by miles. If you really want a doorbell that badly, then I guess get a Ring and have fun changing the terribly short-lasting batteries every day. Or hardwire it into your wall, which, if we're being real here, is something that pretty much nobody ever feels like doing."

The picture is crystal clear and I\u2019m honestly obsessed with checking on my pets now! If you need a mid day pick you up, get this! I smile every time I see them playing or stretching out relaxing. Only flaw I\u2019ve found is when trying to use the follow the motion option it ends up set on my ceiling fan that stays on 100% of the time. Otherwise for the purpose I intended it for it is great quality, it detects my pets and is a nice size to sit on the feeding table I use. I bought a memory card to make setting up that much easier.

        "text": "So, I do security cameras for other folks as part of my job, but I needed an inexpensive, basic camera for inside my own home. This camera does well. Noise and motion detection is good (sometimes too good - it catches reflections real easy!). Yes, you can hear the motor when it turns, so, a little less quality build encasing the motor, but for the price - hey, that's reasonable (so 4 stars). The tracker gets bored quickly and resets to home. There are multiple features on this camera, like the patrol mode and zone monitoring that seem like they might be GREAT features. Frankly, I'm just too lazy to go through all the learning curves to deal with that (and the added features are not overly \"user friendly\" - and if that's the case for me, that means it's not pleasant for the average user, so a bonus, but a waste unless you want to take the time to learn it all). My living room is not large enough to need the full 360deg, and its noise detection can tell if someone's coming from off-screen. It does recognize people (which substituted the patrol mode for me). Great for night vision. Not obnoxious in size. Not intrusive. It's app is pretty basic - just like every other app out there but I DO like NO subscription fees just to \"use\" it (there may be some to store to the cloud?). It may have ads, but I haven't noticed. I did buy my own SD card, got the class 10, 256 GB high fidelity card, and ran this at 2k. Quality was GREAT. I tried 1080. Quality was still amazing. I went down to the 720... and quality was STILL great (but not for face recognition in low light). I'm not looking more than 25 - 30 feet away and the details are MORE than sufficient, giving me even longer record times before it overwrites. It doesn't always alert me on the app when it sees motion, that is touch and go? Maybe a network issue. I did have a 1-time loss of wifi with router at the very beginning, but that remedied itself. (and sometimes, it is slow to connect - but that is all network dependent, not necessarily the camera). Long story short - if someone's breaking into your home, you want to know immediately. You want faces. And, you want to be able to report it. This does that and well enough for the price (in fact, it just beeped at me thru my phone while sitting at work and typing this). Again, it's in the $30 - $40 range... so it's not going to be \"high class\". But, to get to that range, you're \"usually\" jumping into the $200-1200+ per camera category, so... for my tight budget, no. It has some mounting options, nothing fancy (like all others in this price range). It's corded, but you can always find solutions for that (and it's not a hidden cam, so cord doesn't really matter, and no battery powered cam will give you good, constant operations without fast draining). Funny note - it picked up motion on our TV screen while binging Supernatural! As an IT person who does camera set-up security, if you're on a budget, I recommend this. I was going to get a Hiseeu cam because of their quality build, but honestly, the Kasa has audio detection, better audio quality, near the same range of vertical motion, does not have to be mounted up-side down (can sit on its base), is smaller / less obvious, does well at night, does lack the \"emergency lights\" option (unless I'm mistaken, someone please correct me), and has a \"patrol\" mode (which, if you've ever used 360 degree cameras, you suddenly realize that it can't see someone coming from a blind spot and becomes obnoxiously useless without a patrol mode and/or audio detection) - and altogether, even tho the Hiseeu motor is quiet and the build is stronger (and it can pair with an NVR whereas I have no idea if the Kasa can), that STILL makes Kasa the better option for me (on a budget)."

        "text": "Recently, became nearly full time caregiver for my 77 year old mother. we tried a wrist based call bell but her capacity to learn, sadly has diminished. so, needed a discrete way to monitor her remotely. this camera is very discreet and matches the tv stand. she loves framed pictures so there is a pretty discreet opening that alllows nearly 360 degree view of the living room where she spends most of her time. I can move the camera remotely, and it even has a feature that will follow her as she moves. however, thus far i haven't used that feature very much. I think if the camera is moving alot, it may wear out the mechanism prematurely. camera seems well built, and make sure you get a Class 10 micro sd card. I bought amazon basics brand, and it works flawlessly, and if it starts to fail, they are cheap enough to replace. name brands go for over 40.00! yikes. i bought 128gb card. you can go as high as 256gb cards. but 128gb will get you probably over a week of footage. (your mileage may vary) depending on how active the camera is and how busy the area your monitoring is. you can turn off the front LED indicator, so camera is super discrete. the kasa app is super easy to use, and you can subscribe to kasa care for 30 days of recording history if you chose to. it's pretty reasonably priced as well, i personally don't use it, but like having that option.\ncamera ONLY WORKS on 2.5ghz network so make sure your setup allows you to assign devices to 2.4ghz band, word of caution, if your using a ISP supplied router, this won't work. you will need to go with 3rd party router (i use tp link) and it works flawlessly.\nyou can set the camera to listen for sound/motion and even a baby crying. there are settings that can be changed for sensitivty, and you can use patrol mode. camera will move/tilt up and down, at preset intervals.\nyou can talk through the camera if needed, i don't use this feature because i'm doing discreet monitoring.\nI have a very old kasa spot camera (probably 13 years old now) and it still works, but having some intermittent issues. I prefer all my cameras to be of the same brand, so i don't have to cycle through 2 or 3 different apps on my phone. app works well. and you can even download it on your MacBook if using ios. not sure about windows though, ive read it doesn't work with windows based systems.\nThis is a very good deal and a good price point, and has served it's purpose well, and i have only used this particular model for a few days.\nif you need discreet monitoring or surveillance this is a cost effective way to do it. i suggest getting the black one opposed to white. the color white sticks out like a sore thumb, but the black color blends in and assures discretion.\nway to go kasa! great camera at a great price."

I purchased a used version for only $16\u2014what an absolute steal for everything this camera offers! From picture quality to functionality, this camera delivers in every category. Here's my detailed breakdown:\n\nPicture Quality:\nThe 1080p HD video is crystal clear, capturing every detail in both light and dark environments. The night vision is particularly impressive\u2014easily some of the best I\u2019ve seen in any camera at this price range. It provides sharp and clear images, even in complete darkness, which makes it perfect for monitoring pets, children, or your home at night.\n\nAudio:\nThe Audio quality is great and not laggy at all! I was seriously impressed by how clear it is.\n\nPan & Tilt Functionality:\nThis camera's ability to pan and tilt is a game-changer. It provides a full view of the room, from front to back, with no blind spots. The tilt mode can also be set to Activity Tracking, which allows the camera to automatically follow any person or motion it detects. This feature works seamlessly and adds an extra layer of security and convenience.\n\nStorage Options:\nThe ability to use an SD card is a major plus, as it allows for local storage without the need for a subscription. If you prefer cloud storage, that\u2019s also an option, giving you flexibility based on your needs.\n\nMounting & Installation:\nThe camera comes with easy-to-use mounting hardware, making installation a breeze. Whether you want to place it on a shelf or mount it on a wall, it\u2019s simple to set up in minutes.\n\nApp & Smart Integration:\nThe Kasa Smart app is incredibly user-friendly and intuitive. You can view live footage, set up motion zones, control the pan and tilt, and even receive motion alerts\u2014all from your phone. Plus, it integrates perfectly with Alexa and Google Home, allowing you to use voice commands for added convenience.\n\nExtra Features:\nMotion Detection Alerts: Get instant notifications on your phone whenever motion is detected.\nTwo-Way Audio: Communicate directly through the camera using your smartphone, whether you\u2019re checking in on a pet or giving instructions to someone at home.\nCustomizable Motion Zones: You can define specific areas for the camera to monitor, reducing unnecessary alerts.\nWiFi Connectivity: Works seamlessly on 2.4GHz WiFi networks, ensuring a stable connection.\nFinal Thoughts:\nFor just $16 (used), this camera has exceeded my expectations in every way. It\u2019s perfect for monitoring pets, children, or your home, and the pan-tilt function and night vision make it stand out from other cameras in this price range. The Kasa Smart app is intuitive and reliable, and the ability to use local SD card storage means no additional subscription costs.\n\nIf you're looking for a budget-friendly, high-quality indoor security camera with all the bells and whistles, this is it. Whether new or used, the Kasa Smart Indoor Pan-Tilt Camera is an incredible value for its price. Highly recommended! \ud83c\udf1f"

        "text": "These cameras are excellent! The price paid is minimal compared to the total amount of functionality.\nThey do track objects that trigger them, maybe not as smoothly as higher priced options (I don\u2019t know, have not tried others).\nFor the mobility of relocating the camera by simply picking it up and finding a new location, it\u2019s massively more practical than the full wired systems available. Until you know where you want those more expensive cameras to be permanently installed, these cameras are a great alternative! Also, great for keeping a watch on who\u2019s passing by your place at window-level.\n\nWired cameras have to be mounted high enough to be safe from getting ripped down by trespassers, these see through windows during the day very well. Interior night vision is top notch, seeing outside through windows at night is more difficult.\n\nWith the sensitivity turned up, every time a tree branch blows it triggers the cameras. This leads to near constant triggering of alerts during the late Spring, Summer and early Fall.\nAnd, lots of recordings every day. So, you need to use the App to designate areas to watch for motion, or it\u2019ll drive you nuts and frustrate you. To the point that you may start to ignore the notices.\n\nThe App provides great control, and allows remote on/off, sensitivity setting changes, you can set to record noise triggers or remove that, set trigger zones, move the camera via the App, and other adjustments.\nI have noticed that the App actually does offer more functions, and work a little more smoothly, through my phone than my very new tablet. No idea why, it should be the same App for both platforms, no?\nBut, of course watching the playback on the larger screen is so much better, so I do use both.\n\nThe service plan allows storage of recordings from up to 10 cameras for $10 per month. Much more cost effective than others I looked into.\n\nThe cons:\nCan\u2019t see thru glass with the built-in lights, at night. Reflection off the glass blinds the camera.\nThat should have been obvious to me from the start, since these are designed for indoor use only. but I had naively hoped for better night vision performance.\nSo, if looking out a window, get a motion-activated light to trigger so you can see what\u2019s going on out there. Just don\u2019t set it up where it will shine in your bedroom and wake you up.\n\nApp functionality on phone is higher than on tablet, no idea why. You will want to have the App on at least a phone, if not both.\n\nSometimes, some cameras will trigger, others won\u2019t, for the same event.\nDeer moving around the house sometimes are ignored by one camera, recorded by another. Also happened that another outdoor camera from another manufacturer recorded a vehicle trespassing, these cameras didn\u2019t. Had to adjust the sensor sensitivity, but I think the baseline software settings should be set to trigger sooner on vehicles.\n\nBranches moving on the breeze cause constant notices, even with Person Detection Mode activated.\nA more elaborate software system might offer better monitoring, but for the pro systems, this requires fully wired systems with dedicated main recording components/control systems . Much more expensive, and I can\u2019t afford to open the walls throughout the property.\n\nOverall, these are great! I have bought several models, both the fixed ones and the bigger moving ones. All look great when set to the highest recording resolution, seem to last a long time, and are a breeze to set up or switch from spot to spot.\nI very much recommend this camera! I also hope the manufacturer can produce a 4K version."

        "text": "I got this indoor cam months ago and couldnt figure out how to get it going-- then ive have had many health problems that has kept me from getting help. Finally today in July,\nI was able to speak to a Kasa customer service helper named Aldrin... I am so pleased: he had me getting the camera connected and working in just a few minutes. I'm so happy because now I can get my outdoor version of this camera that shows via motion detection who or what is happening. I'm very grateful to Aldrin at kasa support. So the cool part of this device is the sd card is safely tucked below in the tilt panel below camera lens. This model moves about in Pan and tilt and left and right 360 motions. I did need to download the kasa app.\nmake sure you know your wifi password before starting the process. It was way easier to set up with help. If you don't understand something don't be afraid to contact support. It appears to me this is a fine little security cam. I got this to monitor my cats (and visiting animals) inside my garage. Not exposed to rain etc. So its inside. It is set to notify me when they come into area of detection. I have other kasa smart home plugs so I wanted to stay with a company I already liked. I do recommend this if it's your first camera.\nIt can record 24/7 onto my 128gb SD card, after the first 24hrs it used very little memory of the128gb. I figure I will erase it at some point.\nBut I saw you can subscribe to a kasa \"cloud type\" service. I was in a hurry so I didn't read that offer. I figured I can do later."

        "text": "I am writing this review for the Kasa smart indoor camera EC70, features may change from past to future models. I do have a separate security system for the outdoors, and I wanted something simple and portable to use indoors. I chose the Kasa camera because I already have the Kasa smart plugs. For about $20 dollars this is a camera with a lot of nice features. It is extremely easy to install and use. First, download the Kasa Smart App and create an account. Second, plug the camera into a power source, open the app add the camera and follow the directions. Once added, use the 3rd party tab to add to your Alexa account and google home account. If you already have added those accounts, then the camera will automatically be added and you can access it through the Alexa and google home app. The camera once added did require a firmware update and this took about 2 minutes. Some helpful tips I learned during my encounter with set up. The EC70 camera will accept a microSD card from 8 to 256GB used for local storage. Even though it tells you during set up to add, you will NOT be able to do so unless the camera is tilted up as high as it can go. So, you may have to finish set up, then start the camera and tilt it up before you can install it. For the Alexa app, the app will NOT turn the EC70 camera on or off. I am able to connect the camera to my Echo Show and FireTV only. The camera WILL send notifications to any Amazon device, and you are able to pick which devices to receive notifications. For google home, it is essentially the same, you need to have a Nest or Chromecast device in order to view the EC70 camera output. You probably will need to use the google help page for instructions on how to set it up. You can set the EC70 camera for different views of the area you wish to see, and can also place it on patrol mode to automatically move to each view. There are a wide range of positions available to meet your particular specifications and needs. The camera is mobile, unless you attach it to a wall or ceiling with the included bracket. The picture quality is great, and you do have options for the video quality settings depending on your wifi. I read other reviews and some of the negativity of the EC70 camera most likely is due to your wifi, not the actual equipment. I have used this camera to watch the front door when I am in the back, and also to watch the dogs. It is nice to receive the notification that they are at the door, so I can let them out to do their business. I am very happy with my purchase. I hope you find this review helpful."

        "text": "EXTREMELY EASY TO USE \u2022 COST-EFFECTIVE \u2022 VERSATILE \u2022 SATISFYING: I happened to buy a 4-pack of Kasa smart plugs recently. After experiencing firsthand how easy it was to integrate them into my existing and very average home Wi-Fi system - not to mention tie their control into existing Amazon smart devices such as my Echo Dot and EchoPop - I simply couldn't resist the urge to (join the rest of you in the 21st century and) purchase a camera.\n\nAPPLICATION: I wanted an easy to buy, implement, use and maintain a remote controllable and reasonably 'smart' surveillance system - just to keep an eye on things that happen on the street. I learned very quickly the Kasa camera system has features that enable it to not only track motion but specifically people when desired (see Activity Zones IMG) ; features include various levels of tracking up to and including \"Patrol Mode\" which will cause the camera to rotate through the four savable \"scenes\" at the specified interval(s) allowing for 360\u00b0 monitoring from just one camera. Even has NIGHT VISION.\n\nI actually bought two cameras and haven't even set up the second one because the first is already doing so much!\n\nTIPS & TRICKS: Make sure you purchase a reasonable quality 64 GB mini SD card. That is the maximum size card this model of Kasa camera can utilize. TO INSERT THE CARD: using the mobile interface pan the camera upward until the mini SD card port and reset buttons are exposed (see IMGs.) Insert the card LABEL UP and press until firmly clicked and secured in its final position. I have been running the camera \"24/7\" (the actual mode is known as \"24/7 Monitoring\") at maximum resolution of 1080p for ~ 3 days and have used less than 25% of the 64 GB capacity. (see IMGs)\n\nHOW TO SAVE EVIDENCE: Should something unfortunate occur and you find yourself in the position of needing to save that which your camera captured you can simply click on \"24/7 recording\" & move the saved timeline bar to the requisite point, wait for playback to start and click the \ud83d\udd34 in the lower right-hand portion on the playback screen. (Note: Give the video recall some time - after all it is the camera having to go back and read saved data while still recording and saving new data, transmit saved data through the Wi-Fi network to your phone and ultimately save it in a new location. Even the fastest systems will take a moment.) Following these steps will save a video of what was recorded that you will find in your video gallery. *There is a portion of the app allocated to Activity Alerts Tracking which is available with a Kasa Care subscription; I do not have that subscription thus I am unable to speak to those features at this time but imagine they facilitate easier activity recall and saving.\n\nWHAT TO DO NOW: Click purchase. \ud83d\ude0a Seriously this thing is fabulous especially for the price point. Off the top of my head some of the easiest applications I can think of would be keeping an eye on your pets or your kids while they're at home or having an extra pair of eyes when needed.\n\n*** Keep in mind this review is written from the standpoint of someone seeking easy applications and easy use - If you are looking for something that is sturdy, has own/redundant power, data storage and signaling capacity, is designed to survive not only adverse weather/climate but also potential tampering this is not the device I would recommend."

        "text": "Tried a WYZE v4 first but turns out it was about as useful a camera as a brick would be.\n\nIt would NOT connect to my WIFI from either of my routers(I have a Xfinity modem/router but it's old so I bought a Netgear Nighthawk some years ago to boost the signal at a one time cost rather than renting extra equipment every month from Xfinity cause they refuse to replace anything that's outdated), it would NOT get detected by the WYZE app whether I used the same wifi signal or not so I couldn't even troubleshoot it since the app didn't know it existed in the first place. To make matters worse it costs $45 which is the most expensive brick I ever owned in my life so I returned it for a full refund and decided to try 1 more time with a cheaper but comparable camera. That's when I picked this up.\n\nI went in a skeptic assuming I would have the same problems as I always did with WYZE(tried a v3 or maybe v2 years ago, same problem as the v4 so I guess WYZE is just incapable of actual improvement and favors dumb gimmicks instead. The only thing that changed was the app layout which admittedly LOOKS better now but looks can be deceiving...)\n\nTurns out I was wrong and NOT every camera on Amazon is an overpriced pile of junk! This camera is half the price, connected immediately with 0 delays and functions exactly as advertised. This cameras App has performed nearly perfectly and I can even move this camera FAR from my router without any impact on the signal quality. I can keep my phone on 5G and STILL use EVERY feature on the app. I can also be far away from my router, house, and this camera without losing any features. That means I can get notified of activities, pan/tilt manually, toggle NV, change app settings/schedules, set up to 4 viewpoints, set detection zones in said viewpoints, record manually, turn the status LED on/off, download recorded activities(manual recordings OR detection-based recordings) and Etc...\n\nThe cloud service is cheap but in a GOOD way. Only $3/month per device(up to 4) or $10/month for up to 10 devices which is extremely affordable.\n\nThe quality of videos is very good IMO although I do wish the Frame rate was a little higher(I don't KNOW the exact Frame Rate but I'm a big time Gamer who just loves loves LOVES to toggle his FPS display ON and set it to high accuracy mode.) Based on what I have seen so far I think it's about 10-15 FPS so really fast movements will look like a smudge but natural movements shouldn't have that problem. It might not be the BEST option for monitoring(I don't know WHAT is cause this is only my 3rd attempt at finding a decent camera for basic monitoring but it's gone above and beyond my expectations at this pricepoint.) I'm actually about to get 2 or 3 more of these once I finish and submit my updated review.\n\nSome notes:\nWhen you plug it in for the first time it will probably start moving suddenly on it's own, this is NORMAL. It's a way to test the motor and range of motion for the pan/tilt feature and can be done manually in the app as well. I've moved to different outlets twice now and it has not done that on it's own either time leading me to believe it's only a one-time automated check up of sorts.\n\nBy coincidence, I found one minor flaw on the app which I'm not sure was a fluke or an actual Bug. I was watching a live video feed and tried to manually record something I wasn't sure would trigger motion detection but apparently it DID and my fool self forgot about the minor delay so it popped up in my notification panel \"Activity detected on ___\" but did not appear in the app right away so I refreshed it.

        "text": "To clarify, this is NOT a bad camera. Quite the opposite, as a matter of fact. I have the same camera, just the slightly \"cheaper\" version. When I say, \"cheaper\" I don't mean cheap. I just mean it costs less. I would not classify either version as cheap. If this review were for the \"basic\" model, it would have five stars. The reason for this model receiving just 3 of 5 possible stars is because there is an option for the camera to pan and tilt. It has motion detection and will automatically patrol if you choose it to do so. These functionalities all work fine and as expected. The motion sensing is actually pretty great and from an upstairs window it will catch people walking all the way across the street, which is much farther than the advertised 30 foot distance. The night vision works, but not through a window.\n\nI've never had any connection problems after having gotten it initially setup. That was kind of a pain, in all honesty. You wouldn't think it, but manually scrolling the camera to point upwards just to reach the reset button or to access the SD card is a poor design choice, in my opinion. The fact that's where the reset connection button is also makes it annoying, because you press and hold the button for it to begin doing its thing, searching for networks and devices and whatnot. Sometimes it will find the network and everything you're looking for right away, but other times it gives you the most confusing run around until you've disconnected and restarted the camera about a dozen times.\n\nThat being said, once you get the camera connected to your network and through the app, it works pretty flawlessly. It does load a little bit slow, so if you get a notification and open it up live, the motion that it caught may have already come and gone, but you can always revert to the 24/7 recording function and search through the recording history with footnotes that will take you right to the motion or object detection. Say a person walks by, it will save a bookmark for person detected. With a 256gb SD card, my camera tends to hold about 2-3 weeks worth of footage and I record 24/7.\n\nI used the motion tracking feature for a little while after I first got the camera so that I could follow people to see which direction they've gone after they pass my apartment. I have my parking space right in front of my unit, but someone still slashed the tires one night, hence the camera. It's a great feature, but I have a lot of car and foot traffic in front of my house that caused the camera to be panning left and right far too often. I didn't want to overwork it, so I turned it off. I don't think this is a quality issue here, but a motor/gear issue within the camera body itself that controls the panning and tilting functions that sound like they'll get pretty tired pretty soon if there's a lot of motion tracking. It doesn't sound terrible and it's only as loud as a very small fraction of a vibrating phone when it turns, but in a quiet room and it's tracking people in the early morning it's enough for you to want it to stop. But it's as easy as opening the settings and turning off motion tracking, but it will still record. If you have constant patrol or motion tracking, it's likely to run out of motor power sooner than later. I didn't want to put it to the test, because you can set \"viewpoints\" to your devices. I set up three viewpoints to cover my parking space and vehicle. I have a viewpoint to the left, with my vehicle on the right side of the frame. I have a second viewpoint that points directly at my vehicle, dead center in the parking space, and I have another viewpoint that keeps my vehicle in the left side of the frame. I can view a large swath of the street in front of my house and my neighbors feel better knowing I have a decent camera, because we all know that our complexes security cameras suck and point at nothing of importance.\n\nSo, to hit the algorithm for the cameras durability - I don't think they're waterproof, I wouldn't want to drop it, it is made out of cheap plastic after all, but I've never had any lens issues so far. My biggest worry about it's long-term durability would be focused mostly on the gears and motor that turns and pans the camera.\n\nWithin the My Kasa app, you can open it and it will display your list of devices, assuming you have multiple. If it's just a single device, it will show just the one device. You can select your device and it will pull up its real-time live feed. There is a microphone and audio settings on it, so if it's inside you can talk to your dog or whatever, you can hear your dog bark etc.\n\nMy other issue with this camera, and this is specifically about the white version of the camera that supposedly has a higher quality of video (something I could not tell the difference between, I'll explain here shortly) is the fact that when it does go through motion tracking or any sort of panning, it will return to its original viewpoint. That would be fine, having my vehicle dead center, but the viewpoint tells itself that the real viewpoint is several degrees off and is often pointing a bit higher than you originally had the viewpoint set. This leads you to having to reset the pan/tilt of the device almost every time it's done tracking motion.\n\nNow the difference in definition and quality, for me, was negligible, at best. Neither of the cameras could clearly read my license plate, so there was no difference in resolution quality there. I think the white version is supposed to be running a higher quality camera, but I think it's built off of the basic materials still used in the base model, which causes it to have a lag, slight delay, and it takes longer to load in the app. If anything, the higher \"quality\" is actually reduced because I don't think the hardware can withstand the power of the software and the lens capabilities.\n\nLong story short, get the base model for $20 and you won't be happier. Beats a $100 Ring by miles. If you really want a doorbell that badly, then I guess get a Ring and have fun changing the terribly short-lasting batteries every day. Or hardwire it into your wall, which, if we're being real here, is something that pretty much nobody ever feels like doing."

        "text": "So, I do security cameras for other folks as part of my job, but I needed an inexpensive, basic camera for inside my own home. This camera does well. Noise and motion detection is good (sometimes too good - it catches reflections real easy!). Yes, you can hear the motor when it turns, so, a little less quality build encasing the motor, but for the price - hey, that's reasonable (so 4 stars). The tracker gets bored quickly and resets to home. There are multiple features on this camera, like the patrol mode and zone monitoring that seem like they might be GREAT features. Frankly, I'm just too lazy to go through all the learning curves to deal with that (and the added features are not overly \"user friendly\" - and if that's the case for me, that means it's not pleasant for the average user, so a bonus, but a waste unless you want to take the time to learn it all). My living room is not large enough to need the full 360deg, and its noise detection can tell if someone's coming from off-screen. It does recognize people (which substituted the patrol mode for me). Great for night vision. Not obnoxious in size. Not intrusive. It's app is pretty basic - just like every other app out there but I DO like NO subscription fees just to \"use\" it (there may be some to store to the cloud?). It may have ads, but I haven't noticed. I did buy my own SD card, got the class 10, 256 GB high fidelity card, and ran this at 2k. Quality was GREAT. I tried 1080. Quality was still amazing. I went down to the 720... and quality was STILL great (but not for face recognition in low light). I'm not looking more than 25 - 30 feet away and the details are MORE than sufficient, giving me even longer record times before it overwrites. It doesn't always alert me on the app when it sees motion, that is touch and go? Maybe a network issue. I did have a 1-time loss of wifi with router at the very beginning, but that remedied itself. (and sometimes, it is slow to connect - but that is all network dependent, not necessarily the camera). Long story short - if someone's breaking into your home, you want to know immediately. You want faces. And, you want to be able to report it. This does that and well enough for the price (in fact, it just beeped at me thru my phone while sitting at work and typing this). Again, it's in the $30 - $40 range... so it's not going to be \"high class\". But, to get to that range, you're \"usually\" jumping into the $200-1200+ per camera category, so... for my tight budget, no. It has some mounting options, nothing fancy (like all others in this price range). It's corded, but you can always find solutions for that (and it's not a hidden cam, so cord doesn't really matter, and no battery powered cam will give you good, constant operations without fast draining). Funny note - it picked up motion on our TV screen while binging Supernatural! As an IT person who does camera set-up security, if you're on a budget, I recommend this. I was going to get a Hiseeu cam because of their quality build, but honestly, the Kasa has audio detection, better audio quality, near the same range of vertical motion, does not have to be mounted up-side down (can sit on its base), is smaller / less obvious, does well at night, does lack the \"emergency lights\" option (unless I'm mistaken, someone please correct me), and has a \"patrol\" mode (which, if you've ever used 360 degree cameras, you suddenly realize that it can't see someone coming from a blind spot and becomes obnoxiously useless without a patrol mode and/or audio detection) - and altogether, even tho the Hiseeu motor is quiet and the build is stronger (and it can pair with an NVR whereas I have no idea if the Kasa can), that STILL makes Kasa the better option for me (on a budget)."

I can move the camera remotely, and it even has a feature that will follow her as she moves. however, thus far i haven't used that feature very much. I think if the camera is moving alot, it may wear out the mechanism prematurely. camera seems well built, and make sure you get a Class 10 micro sd card. I bought amazon basics brand, and it works flawlessly, and if it starts to fail, they are cheap enough to replace. name brands go for over 40.00! yikes. i bought 128gb card. you can go as high as 256gb cards. but 128gb will get you probably over a week of footage. (your mileage may vary) depending on how active the camera is and how busy the area your monitoring is. you can turn off the front LED indicator, so camera is super discrete. the kasa app is super easy to use, and you can subscribe to kasa care for 30 days of recording history if you chose to. it's pretty reasonably priced as well, i personally don't use it, but like having that option.\ncamera ONLY WORKS on 2.5ghz network so make sure your setup allows you to assign devices to 2.4ghz band, word of caution, if your using a ISP supplied router, this won't work. you will need to go with 3rd party router (i use tp link) and it works flawlessly.\nyou can set the camera to listen for sound/motion and even a baby crying. there are settings that can be changed for sensitivty, and you can use patrol mode. camera will move/tilt up and down, at preset intervals.\nyou can talk through the camera if needed, i don't use this feature because i'm doing discreet monitoring.\nI have a very old kasa spot camera (probably 13 years old now) and it still works, but having some intermittent issues. I prefer all my cameras to be of the same brand, so i don't have to cycle through 2 or 3 different apps on my phone. app works well. and you can even download it on your MacBook if using ios. not sure about windows though, ive read it doesn't work with windows based systems.\nThis is a very good deal and a good price point, and has served it's purpose well, and i have only used this particular model for a few days.\nif you need discreet monitoring or surveillance this is a cost effective way to do it. i suggest getting the black one opposed to white. the color white sticks out like a sore thumb, but the black color blends in and assures discretion.\nway to go kasa! great camera at a great price."

The pan and tilt feature is smooth and quiet, which makes it great for keeping an eye on pets or checking different parts of the room without needing multiple cameras.\n\nThe video quality is crisp (especially for 1080p), and the night vision is surprisingly clear. Motion detection alerts come through quickly, and I love that I can view live footage anytime from my phone. It even integrates perfectly with Alexa, so I can pull up the feed hands-free.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s reliable, easy to use, and the peace of mind it gives me is well worth it.

        "text": "The Kasa Smart Indoor Pan-Tilt Home Security Camera (EC71) is a fantastic option for anyone looking to add reliable, high-quality security or monitoring to their home. I purchased a used version for only $16\u2014what an absolute steal for everything this camera offers! From picture quality to functionality, this camera delivers in every category. Here's my detailed breakdown:\n\nPicture Quality:\nThe 1080p HD video is crystal clear, capturing every detail in both light and dark environments. The night vision is particularly impressive\u2014easily some of the best I\u2019ve seen in any camera at this price range. It provides sharp and clear images, even in complete darkness, which makes it perfect for monitoring pets, children, or your home at night.\n\nAudio:\nThe Audio quality is great and not laggy at all! I was seriously impressed by how clear it is.\n\nPan & Tilt Functionality:\nThis camera's ability to pan and tilt is a game-changer. It provides a full view of the room, from front to back, with no blind spots. The tilt mode can also be set to Activity Tracking, which allows the camera to automatically follow any person or motion it detects. This feature works seamlessly and adds an extra layer of security and convenience.\n\nStorage Options:\nThe ability to use an SD card is a major plus, as it allows for local storage without the need for a subscription. If you prefer cloud storage, that\u2019s also an option, giving you flexibility based on your needs.\n\nMounting & Installation:\nThe camera comes with easy-to-use mounting hardware, making installation a breeze. Whether you want to place it on a shelf or mount it on a wall, it\u2019s simple to set up in minutes.\n\nApp & Smart Integration:\nThe Kasa Smart app is incredibly user-friendly and intuitive. You can view live footage, set up motion zones, control the pan and tilt, and even receive motion alerts\u2014all from your phone. Plus, it integrates perfectly with Alexa and Google Home, allowing you to use voice commands for added convenience.\n\nExtra Features:\nMotion Detection Alerts: Get instant notifications on your phone whenever motion is detected.\nTwo-Way Audio: Communicate directly through the camera using your smartphone, whether you\u2019re checking in on a pet or giving instructions to someone at home.\nCustomizable Motion Zones: You can define specific areas for the camera to monitor, reducing unnecessary alerts.\nWiFi Connectivity: Works seamlessly on 2.4GHz WiFi networks, ensuring a stable connection.\nFinal Thoughts:\nFor just $16 (used), this camera has exceeded my expectations in every way. It\u2019s perfect for monitoring pets, children, or your home, and the pan-tilt function and night vision make it stand out from other cameras in this price range. The Kasa Smart app is intuitive and reliable, and the ability to use local SD card storage means no additional subscription costs.\n\nIf you're looking for a budget-friendly, high-quality indoor security camera with all the bells and whistles, this is it. Whether new or used, the Kasa Smart Indoor Pan-Tilt Camera is an incredible value for its price. Highly recommended! \ud83c\udf1f"

        "text": "These cameras are excellent! The price paid is minimal compared to the total amount of functionality.\nThey do track objects that trigger them, maybe not as smoothly as higher priced options (I don\u2019t know, have not tried others).\nFor the mobility of relocating the camera by simply picking it up and finding a new location, it\u2019s massively more practical than the full wired systems available. Until you know where you want those more expensive cameras to be permanently installed, these cameras are a great alternative! Also, great for keeping a watch on who\u2019s passing by your place at window-level.\n\nWired cameras have to be mounted high enough to be safe from getting ripped down by trespassers, these see through windows during the day very well. Interior night vision is top notch, seeing outside through windows at night is more difficult.\n\nWith the sensitivity turned up, every time a tree branch blows it triggers the cameras. This leads to near constant triggering of alerts during the late Spring, Summer and early Fall.\nAnd, lots of recordings every day. So, you need to use the App to designate areas to watch for motion, or it\u2019ll drive you nuts and frustrate you. To the point that you may start to ignore the notices.\n\nThe App provides great control, and allows remote on/off, sensitivity setting changes, you can set to record noise triggers or remove that, set trigger zones, move the camera via the App, and other adjustments.\nI have noticed that the App actually does offer more functions, and work a little more smoothly, through my phone than my very new tablet. No idea why, it should be the same App for both platforms, no?\nBut, of course watching the playback on the larger screen is so much better, so I do use both.\n\nThe service plan allows storage of recordings from up to 10 cameras for $10 per month. Much more cost effective than others I looked into.\n\nThe cons:\nCan\u2019t see thru glass with the built-in lights, at night. Reflection off the glass blinds the camera.\nThat should have been obvious to me from the start, since these are designed for indoor use only. but I had naively hoped for better night vision performance.\nSo, if looking out a window, get a motion-activated light to trigger so you can see what\u2019s going on out there. Just don\u2019t set it up where it will shine in your bedroom and wake you up.\n\nApp functionality on phone is higher than on tablet, no idea why. You will want to have the App on at least a phone, if not both.\n\nSometimes, some cameras will trigger, others won\u2019t, for the same event.\nDeer moving around the house sometimes are ignored by one camera, recorded by another. Also happened that another outdoor camera from another manufacturer recorded a vehicle trespassing, these cameras didn\u2019t. Had to adjust the sensor sensitivity, but I think the baseline software settings should be set to trigger sooner on vehicles.\n\nBranches moving on the breeze cause constant notices, even with Person Detection Mode activated.\nA more elaborate software system might offer better monitoring, but for the pro systems, this requires fully wired systems with dedicated main recording components/control systems . Much more expensive, and I can\u2019t afford to open the walls throughout the property.\n\nOverall, these are great! I have bought several models, both the fixed ones and the bigger moving ones. All look great when set to the highest recording resolution, seem to last a long time, and are a breeze to set up or switch from spot to spot.\nI very much recommend this camera! I also hope the manufacturer can produce a 4K version."

Finally today in July,\nI was able to speak to a Kasa customer service helper named Aldrin... I am so pleased: he had me getting the camera connected and working in just a few minutes. I'm so happy because now I can get my outdoor version of this camera that shows via motion detection who or what is happening. I'm very grateful to Aldrin at kasa support. So the cool part of this device is the sd card is safely tucked below in the tilt panel below camera lens. This model moves about in Pan and tilt and left and right 360 motions. I did need to download the kasa app.\nmake sure you know your wifi password before starting the process. It was way easier to set up with help. If you don't understand something don't be afraid to contact support. It appears to me this is a fine little security cam. I got this to monitor my cats (and visiting animals) inside my garage. Not exposed to rain etc. So its inside. It is set to notify me when they come into area of detection. I have other kasa smart home plugs so I wanted to stay with a company I already liked. I do recommend this if it's your first camera.\nIt can record 24/7 onto my 128gb SD card, after the first 24hrs it used very little memory of the128gb. I figure I will erase it at some point.\nBut I saw you can subscribe to a kasa \"cloud type\" service. I was in a hurry so I didn't read that offer. I figured I can do later."

        "text": "I am writing this review for the Kasa smart indoor camera EC70, features may change from past to future models. I do have a separate security system for the outdoors, and I wanted something simple and portable to use indoors. I chose the Kasa camera because I already have the Kasa smart plugs. For about $20 dollars this is a camera with a lot of nice features. It is extremely easy to install and use. First, download the Kasa Smart App and create an account. Second, plug the camera into a power source, open the app add the camera and follow the directions. Once added, use the 3rd party tab to add to your Alexa account and google home account. If you already have added those accounts, then the camera will automatically be added and you can access it through the Alexa and google home app. The camera once added did require a firmware update and this took about 2 minutes. Some helpful tips I learned during my encounter with set up. The EC70 camera will accept a microSD card from 8 to 256GB used for local storage. Even though it tells you during set up to add, you will NOT be able to do so unless the camera is tilted up as high as it can go. So, you may have to finish set up, then start the camera and tilt it up before you can install it. For the Alexa app, the app will NOT turn the EC70 camera on or off. I am able to connect the camera to my Echo Show and FireTV only. The camera WILL send notifications to any Amazon device, and you are able to pick which devices to receive notifications. For google home, it is essentially the same, you need to have a Nest or Chromecast device in order to view the EC70 camera output. You probably will need to use the google help page for instructions on how to set it up. You can set the EC70 camera for different views of the area you wish to see, and can also place it on patrol mode to automatically move to each view. There are a wide range of positions available to meet your particular specifications and needs. The camera is mobile, unless you attach it to a wall or ceiling with the included bracket. The picture quality is great, and you do have options for the video quality settings depending on your wifi. I read other reviews and some of the negativity of the EC70 camera most likely is due to your wifi, not the actual equipment. I have used this camera to watch the front door when I am in the back, and also to watch the dogs. It is nice to receive the notification that they are at the door, so I can let them out to do their business. I am very happy with my purchase. I hope you find this review helpful."

        "text": "EXTREMELY EASY TO USE \u2022 COST-EFFECTIVE \u2022 VERSATILE \u2022 SATISFYING: I happened to buy a 4-pack of Kasa smart plugs recently. After experiencing firsthand how easy it was to integrate them into my existing and very average home Wi-Fi system - not to mention tie their control into existing Amazon smart devices such as my Echo Dot and EchoPop - I simply couldn't resist the urge to (join the rest of you in the 21st century and) purchase a camera.\n\nAPPLICATION: I wanted an easy to buy, implement, use and maintain a remote controllable and reasonably 'smart' surveillance system - just to keep an eye on things that happen on the street. I learned very quickly the Kasa camera system has features that enable it to not only track motion but specifically people when desired (see Activity Zones IMG) ; features include various levels of tracking up to and including \"Patrol Mode\" which will cause the camera to rotate through the four savable \"scenes\" at the specified interval(s) allowing for 360\u00b0 monitoring from just one camera. Even has NIGHT VISION.\n\nI actually bought two cameras and haven't even set up the second one because the first is already doing so much!\n\nTIPS & TRICKS: Make sure you purchase a reasonable quality 64 GB mini SD card. That is the maximum size card this model of Kasa camera can utilize. TO INSERT THE CARD: using the mobile interface pan the camera upward until the mini SD card port and reset buttons are exposed (see IMGs.) Insert the card LABEL UP and press until firmly clicked and secured in its final position. I have been running the camera \"24/7\" (the actual mode is known as \"24/7 Monitoring\") at maximum resolution of 1080p for ~ 3 days and have used less than 25% of the 64 GB capacity. (see IMGs)\n\nHOW TO SAVE EVIDENCE: Should something unfortunate occur and you find yourself in the position of needing to save that which your camera captured you can simply click on \"24/7 recording\" & move the saved timeline bar to the requisite point, wait for playback to start and click the \ud83d\udd34 in the lower right-hand portion on the playback screen. (Note: Give the video recall some time - after all it is the camera having to go back and read saved data while still recording and saving new data, transmit saved data through the Wi-Fi network to your phone and ultimately save it in a new location. Even the fastest systems will take a moment.) Following these steps will save a video of what was recorded that you will find in your video gallery. *There is a portion of the app allocated to Activity Alerts Tracking which is available with a Kasa Care subscription; I do not have that subscription thus I am unable to speak to those features at this time but imagine they facilitate easier activity recall and saving.\n\nWHAT TO DO NOW: Click purchase. \ud83d\ude0a Seriously this thing is fabulous especially for the price point. Off the top of my head some of the easiest applications I can think of would be keeping an eye on your pets or your kids while they're at home or having an extra pair of eyes when needed.\n\n*** Keep in mind this review is written from the standpoint of someone seeking easy applications and easy use - If you are looking for something that is sturdy, has own/redundant power, data storage and signaling capacity, is designed to survive not only adverse weather/climate but also potential tampering this is not the device I would recommend."

        "text": "Tried a WYZE v4 first but turns out it was about as useful a camera as a brick would be.\n\nIt would NOT connect to my WIFI from either of my routers(I have a Xfinity modem/router but it's old so I bought a Netgear Nighthawk some years ago to boost the signal at a one time cost rather than renting extra equipment every month from Xfinity cause they refuse to replace anything that's outdated), it would NOT get detected by the WYZE app whether I used the same wifi signal or not so I couldn't even troubleshoot it since the app didn't know it existed in the first place. To make matters worse it costs $45 which is the most expensive brick I ever owned in my life so I returned it for a full refund and decided to try 1 more time with a cheaper but comparable camera. That's when I picked this up.\n\nI went in a skeptic assuming I would have the same problems as I always did with WYZE(tried a v3 or maybe v2 years ago, same problem as the v4 so I guess WYZE is just incapable of actual improvement and favors dumb gimmicks instead. The only thing that changed was the app layout which admittedly LOOKS better now but looks can be deceiving...)\n\nTurns out I was wrong and NOT every camera on Amazon is an overpriced pile of junk! This camera is half the price, connected immediately with 0 delays and functions exactly as advertised. This cameras App has performed nearly perfectly and I can even move this camera FAR from my router without any impact on the signal quality. I can keep my phone on 5G and STILL use EVERY feature on the app. I can also be far away from my router, house, and this camera without losing any features. That means I can get notified of activities, pan/tilt manually, toggle NV, change app settings/schedules, set up to 4 viewpoints, set detection zones in said viewpoints, record manually, turn the status LED on/off, download recorded activities(manual recordings OR detection-based recordings) and Etc...\n\nThe cloud service is cheap but in a GOOD way. Only $3/month per device(up to 4) or $10/month for up to 10 devices which is extremely affordable.\n\nThe quality of videos is very good IMO although I do wish the Frame rate was a little higher(I don't KNOW the exact Frame Rate but I'm a big time Gamer who just loves loves LOVES to toggle his FPS display ON and set it to high accuracy mode.) Based on what I have seen so far I think it's about 10-15 FPS so really fast movements will look like a smudge but natural movements shouldn't have that problem. It might not be the BEST option for monitoring(I don't know WHAT is cause this is only my 3rd attempt at finding a decent camera for basic monitoring but it's gone above and beyond my expectations at this pricepoint.) I'm actually about to get 2 or 3 more of these once I finish and submit my updated review.\n\nSome notes:\nWhen you plug it in for the first time it will probably start moving suddenly on it's own, this is NORMAL. It's a way to test the motor and range of motion for the pan/tilt feature and can be done manually in the app as well. I've moved to different outlets twice now and it has not done that on it's own either time leading me to believe it's only a one-time automated check up of sorts.\n\nBy coincidence, I found one minor flaw on the app which I'm not sure was a fluke or an actual Bug. I was watching a live video feed and tried to manually record something I wasn't sure would trigger motion detection but apparently it DID and my fool self forgot about the minor delay so it popped up in my notification panel \"Activity detected on ___\" but did not appear in the app right away so I refreshed it. When I went to reciew download it"

        "text": "To clarify, this is NOT a bad camera. Quite the opposite, as a matter of fact. I have the same camera, just the slightly \"cheaper\" version. When I say, \"cheaper\" I don't mean cheap. I just mean it costs less. I would not classify either version as cheap. If this review were for the \"basic\" model, it would have five stars. The reason for this model receiving just 3 of 5 possible stars is because there is an option for the camera to pan and tilt. It has motion detection and will automatically patrol if you choose it to do so. These functionalities all work fine and as expected. The motion sensing is actually pretty great and from an upstairs window it will catch people walking all the way across the street, which is much farther than the advertised 30 foot distance. The night vision works, but not through a window.\n\nI've never had any connection problems after having gotten it initially setup. That was kind of a pain, in all honesty. You wouldn't think it, but manually scrolling the camera to point upwards just to reach the reset button or to access the SD card is a poor design choice, in my opinion. The fact that's where the reset connection button is also makes it annoying, because you press and hold the button for it to begin doing its thing, searching for networks and devices and whatnot. Sometimes it will find the network and everything you're looking for right away, but other times it gives you the most confusing run around until you've disconnected and restarted the camera about a dozen times.\n\nThat being said, once you get the camera connected to your network and through the app, it works pretty flawlessly. It does load a little bit slow, so if you get a notification and open it up live, the motion that it caught may have already come and gone, but you can always revert to the 24/7 recording function and search through the recording history with footnotes that will take you right to the motion or object detection. Say a person walks by, it will save a bookmark for person detected. With a 256gb SD card, my camera tends to hold about 2-3 weeks worth of footage and I record 24/7.\n\nI used the motion tracking feature for a little while after I first got the camera so that I could follow people to see which direction they've gone after they pass my apartment. I have my parking space right in front of my unit, but someone still slashed the tires one night, hence the camera. It's a great feature, but I have a lot of car and foot traffic in front of my house that caused the camera to be panning left and right far too often. I didn't want to overwork it, so I turned it off. I don't think this is a quality issue here, but a motor/gear issue within the camera body itself that controls the panning and tilting functions that sound like they'll get pretty tired pretty soon if there's a lot of motion tracking. It doesn't sound terrible and it's only as loud as a very small fraction of a vibrating phone when it turns, but in a quiet room and it's tracking people in the early morning it's enough for you to want it to stop. But it's as easy as opening the settings and turning off motion tracking, but it will still record. If you have constant patrol or motion tracking, it's likely to run out of motor power sooner than later. I didn't want to put it to the test, because you can set \"viewpoints\" to your devices. I set up three viewpoints to cover my parking space and vehicle. I have a viewpoint to the left, with my vehicle on the right side of the frame. I have a second viewpoint that points directly at my vehicle, dead center in the parking space, and I have another viewpoint that keeps my vehicle in the left side of the frame. I can view a large swath of the street in front of my house and my neighbors feel better knowing I have a decent camera, because we all know that our complexes security cameras suck and point at nothing of importance.\n\nSo, to hit the algorithm for the cameras durability - I don't think they're waterproof, I wouldn't want to drop it, it is made out of cheap plastic after all, but I've never had any lens issues so far. My biggest worry about it's long-term durability would be focused mostly on the gears and motor that turns and pans the camera.\n\nWithin the My Kasa app, you can open it and it will display your list of devices, assuming you have multiple. If it's just a single device, it will show just the one device. You can select your device and it will pull up its real-time live feed. There is a microphone and audio settings on it, so if it's inside you can talk to your dog or whatever, you can hear your dog bark etc.\n\nMy other issue with this camera, and this is specifically about the white version of the camera that supposedly has a higher quality of video (something I could not tell the difference between, I'll explain here shortly) is the fact that when it does go through motion tracking or any sort of panning, it will return to its original viewpoint. That would be fine, having my vehicle dead center, but the viewpoint tells itself that the real viewpoint is several degrees off and is often pointing a bit higher than you originally had the viewpoint set. This leads you to having to reset the pan/tilt of the device almost every time it's done tracking motion.\n\nNow the difference in definition and quality, for me, was negligible, at best. Neither of the cameras could clearly read my license plate, so there was no difference in resolution quality there. I think the white version is supposed to be running a higher quality camera, but I think it's built off of the basic materials still used in the base model, which causes it to have a lag, slight delay, and it takes longer to load in the app. If anything, the higher \"quality\" is actually reduced because I don't think the hardware can withstand the power of the software and the lens capabilities.\n\nLong story short, get the base model for $20 and you won't be happier. Beats a $100 Ring by miles. If you really want a doorbell that badly, then I guess get a Ring and have fun changing the terribly short-lasting batteries every day. Or hardwire it into your wall, which, if we're being real here, is something that pretty much nobody ever feels like doing."

        "text": "So, I do security cameras for other folks as part of my job, but I needed an inexpensive, basic camera for inside my own home. This camera does well. Noise and motion detection is good (sometimes too good - it catches reflections real easy!). Yes, you can hear the motor when it turns, so, a little less quality build encasing the motor, but for the price - hey, that's reasonable (so 4 stars). The tracker gets bored quickly and resets to home. There are multiple features on this camera, like the patrol mode and zone monitoring that seem like they might be GREAT features. Frankly, I'm just too lazy to go through all the learning curves to deal with that (and the added features are not overly \"user friendly\" - and if that's the case for me, that means it's not pleasant for the average user, so a bonus, but a waste unless you want to take the time to learn it all). My living room is not large enough to need the full 360deg, and its noise detection can tell if someone's coming from off-screen. It does recognize people (which substituted the patrol mode for me). Great for night vision. Not obnoxious in size. Not intrusive. It's app is pretty basic - just like every other app out there but I DO like NO subscription fees just to \"use\" it (there may be some to store to the cloud?). It may have ads, but I haven't noticed. I did buy my own SD card, got the class 10, 256 GB high fidelity card, and ran this at 2k. Quality was GREAT. I tried 1080. Quality was still amazing. I went down to the 720... and quality was STILL great (but not for face recognition in low light). I'm not looking more than 25 - 30 feet away and the details are MORE than sufficient, giving me even longer record times before it overwrites. It doesn't always alert me on the app when it sees motion, that is touch and go? Maybe a network issue. I did have a 1-time loss of wifi with router at the very beginning, but that remedied itself. (and sometimes, it is slow to connect - but that is all network dependent, not necessarily the camera). Long story short - if someone's breaking into your home, you want to know immediately. You want faces. And, you want to be able to report it. This does that and well enough for the price (in fact, it just beeped at me thru my phone while sitting at work and typing this). Again, it's in the $30 - $40 range... so it's not going to be \"high class\". But, to get to that range, you're \"usually\" jumping into the $200-1200+ per camera category, so... for my tight budget, no. It has some mounting options, nothing fancy (like all others in this price range). It's corded, but you can always find solutions for that (and it's not a hidden cam, so cord doesn't really matter, and no battery powered cam will give you good, constant operations without fast draining). Funny note - it picked up motion on our TV screen while binging Supernatural! As an IT person who does camera set-up security, if you're on a budget, I recommend this. I was going to get a Hiseeu cam because of their quality build, but honestly, the Kasa has audio detection, better audio quality, near the same range of vertical motion, does not have to be mounted up-side down (can sit on its base), is smaller / less obvious, does well at night, does lack the \"emergency lights\" option (unless I'm mistaken, someone please correct me), and has a \"patrol\" mode (which, if you've ever used 360 degree cameras, you suddenly realize that it can't see someone coming from a blind spot and becomes obnoxiously useless without a patrol mode and/or audio detection) - and altogether, even tho the Hiseeu motor is quiet and the build is stronger (and it can pair with an NVR whereas I have no idea if the Kasa can), that STILL makes Kasa the better option for me (on a budget)."

        "text": "Recently, became nearly full time caregiver for my 77 year old mother. we tried a wrist based call bell but her capacity to learn, sadly has diminished. so, needed a discrete way to monitor her remotely. this camera is very discreet and matches the tv stand. she loves framed pictures so there is a pretty discreet opening that alllows nearly 360 degree view of the living room where she spends most of her time. I can move the camera remotely, and it even has a feature that will follow her as she moves. however, thus far i haven't used that feature very much. I think if the camera is moving alot, it may wear out the mechanism prematurely. camera seems well built, and make sure you get a Class 10 micro sd card. I bought amazon basics brand, and it works flawlessly, and if it starts to fail, they are cheap enough to replace. name brands go for over 40.00! yikes. i bought 128gb card. you can go as high as 256gb cards. but 128gb will get you probably over a week of footage. (your mileage may vary) depending on how active the camera is and how busy the area your monitoring is. you can turn off the front LED indicator, so camera is super discrete. the kasa app is super easy to use, and you can subscribe to kasa care for 30 days of recording history if you chose to. it's pretty reasonably priced as well, i personally don't use it, but like having that option.\ncamera ONLY WORKS on 2.5ghz network so make sure your setup allows you to assign devices to 2.4ghz band, word of caution, if your using a ISP supplied router, this won't work. you will need to go with 3rd party router (i use tp link) and it works flawlessly.\nyou can set the camera to listen for sound/motion and even a baby crying. there are settings that can be changed for sensitivty, and you can use patrol mode. camera will move/tilt up and down, at preset intervals.\nyou can talk through the camera if needed, i don't use this feature because i'm doing discreet monitoring.\nI have a very old kasa spot camera (probably 13 years old now) and it still works, but having some intermittent issues. I prefer all my cameras to be of the same brand, so i don't have to cycle through 2 or 3 different apps on my phone. app works well. and you can even download it on your MacBook if using ios. not sure about windows though, ive read it doesn't work with windows based systems.\nThis is a very good deal and a good price point, and has served it's purpose well, and i have only used this particular model for a few days.\nif you need discreet monitoring or surveillance this is a cost effective way to do it. i suggest getting the black one opposed to white. the color white sticks out like a sore thumb, but the black color blends in and assures discretion.\nway to go kasa! great camera at a great price."

I purchased a used version for only $16\u2014what an absolute steal for everything this camera offers! From picture quality to functionality, this camera delivers in every category. Here's my detailed breakdown:\n\nPicture Quality:\nThe 1080p HD video is crystal clear, capturing every detail in both light and dark environments. The night vision is particularly impressive\u2014easily some of the best I\u2019ve seen in any camera at this price range. It provides sharp and clear images, even in complete darkness, which makes it perfect for monitoring pets, children, or your home at night.\n\nAudio:\nThe Audio quality is great and not laggy at all! I was seriously impressed by how clear it is.\n\nPan & Tilt Functionality:\nThis camera's ability to pan and tilt is a game-changer. It provides a full view of the room, from front to back, with no blind spots. The tilt mode can also be set to Activity Tracking, which allows the camera to automatically follow any person or motion it detects. This feature works seamlessly and adds an extra layer of security and convenience.\n\nStorage Options:\nThe ability to use an SD card is a major plus, as it allows for local storage without the need for a subscription. If you prefer cloud storage, that\u2019s also an option, giving you flexibility based on your needs.\n\nMounting & Installation:\nThe camera comes with easy-to-use mounting hardware, making installation a breeze. Whether you want to place it on a shelf or mount it on a wall, it\u2019s simple to set up in minutes.\n\nApp & Smart Integration:\nThe Kasa Smart app is incredibly user-friendly and intuitive. You can view live footage, set up motion zones, control the pan and tilt, and even receive motion alerts\u2014all from your phone. Plus, it integrates perfectly with Alexa and Google Home, allowing you to use voice commands for added convenience.\n\nExtra Features:\nMotion Detection Alerts: Get instant notifications on your phone whenever motion is detected.\nTwo-Way Audio: Communicate directly through the camera using your smartphone, whether you\u2019re checking in on a pet or giving instructions to someone at home.\nCustomizable Motion Zones: You can define specific areas for the camera to monitor, reducing unnecessary alerts.\nWiFi Connectivity: Works seamlessly on 2.4GHz WiFi networks, ensuring a stable connection.\nFinal Thoughts:\nFor just $16 (used), this camera has exceeded my expectations in every way. It\u2019s perfect for monitoring pets, children, or your home, and the pan-tilt function and night vision make it stand out from other cameras in this price range. The Kasa Smart app is intuitive and reliable, and the ability to use local SD card storage means no additional subscription costs.\n\nIf you're looking for a budget-friendly, high-quality indoor security camera with all the bells and whistles, this is it. Whether new or used, the Kasa Smart Indoor Pan-Tilt Camera is an incredible value for its price. Highly recommended! \ud83c\udf1f"

        "text": "These cameras are excellent! The price paid is minimal compared to the total amount of functionality.\nThey do track objects that trigger them, maybe not as smoothly as higher priced options (I don\u2019t know, have not tried others).\nFor the mobility of relocating the camera by simply picking it up and finding a new location, it\u2019s massively more practical than the full wired systems available. Until you know where you want those more expensive cameras to be permanently installed, these cameras are a great alternative! Also, great for keeping a watch on who\u2019s passing by your place at window-level.\n\nWired cameras have to be mounted high enough to be safe from getting ripped down by trespassers, these see through windows during the day very well. Interior night vision is top notch, seeing outside through windows at night is more difficult.\n\nWith the sensitivity turned up, every time a tree branch blows it triggers the cameras. This leads to near constant triggering of alerts during the late Spring, Summer and early Fall.\nAnd, lots of recordings every day. So, you need to use the App to designate areas to watch for motion, or it\u2019ll drive you nuts and frustrate you. To the point that you may start to ignore the notices.\n\nThe App provides great control, and allows remote on/off, sensitivity setting changes, you can set to record noise triggers or remove that, set trigger zones, move the camera via the App, and other adjustments.\nI have noticed that the App actually does offer more functions, and work a little more smoothly, through my phone than my very new tablet. No idea why, it should be the same App for both platforms, no?\nBut, of course watching the playback on the larger screen is so much better, so I do use both.\n\nThe service plan allows storage of recordings from up to 10 cameras for $10 per month. Much more cost effective than others I looked into.\n\nThe cons:\nCan\u2019t see thru glass with the built-in lights, at night. Reflection off the glass blinds the camera.\nThat should have been obvious to me from the start, since these are designed for indoor use only. but I had naively hoped for better night vision performance.\nSo, if looking out a window, get a motion-activated light to trigger so you can see what\u2019s going on out there. Just don\u2019t set it up where it will shine in your bedroom and wake you up.\n\nApp functionality on phone is higher than on tablet, no idea why. You will want to have the App on at least a phone, if not both.\n\nSometimes, some cameras will trigger, others won\u2019t, for the same event.\nDeer moving around the house sometimes are ignored by one camera, recorded by another. Also happened that another outdoor camera from another manufacturer recorded a vehicle trespassing, these cameras didn\u2019t. Had to adjust the sensor sensitivity, but I think the baseline software settings should be set to trigger sooner on vehicles.\n\nBranches moving on the breeze cause constant notices, even with Person Detection Mode activated.\nA more elaborate software system might offer better monitoring, but for the pro systems, this requires fully wired systems with dedicated main recording components/control systems . Much more expensive, and I can\u2019t afford to open the walls throughout the property.\n\nOverall, these are great! I have bought several models, both the fixed ones and the bigger moving ones. All look great when set to the highest recording resolution, seem to last a long time, and are a breeze to set up or switch from spot to spot.\nI very much recommend this camera! I also hope the manufacturer can produce a 4K version."

Finally today in July,\nI was able to speak to a Kasa customer service helper named Aldrin... I am so pleased: he had me getting the camera connected and working in just a few minutes. I'm so happy because now I can get my outdoor version of this camera that shows via motion detection who or what is happening. I'm very grateful to Aldrin at kasa support. So the cool part of this device is the sd card is safely tucked below in the tilt panel below camera lens. This model moves about in Pan and tilt and left and right 360 motions. I did need to download the kasa app.\nmake sure you know your wifi password before starting the process. It was way easier to set up with help. If you don't understand something don't be afraid to contact support. It appears to me this is a fine little security cam. I got this to monitor my cats (and visiting animals) inside my garage. Not exposed to rain etc. So its inside. It is set to notify me when they come into area of detection. I have other kasa smart home plugs so I wanted to stay with a company I already liked. I do recommend this if it's your first camera.\nIt can record 24/7 onto my 128gb SD card, after the first 24hrs it used very little memory of the128gb. I figure I will erase it at some point.\nBut I saw you can subscribe to a kasa \"cloud type\" service. I was in a hurry so I didn't read that offer. I figured I can do later."

        "text": "I am writing this review for the Kasa smart indoor camera EC70, features may change from past to future models. I do have a separate security system for the outdoors, and I wanted something simple and portable to use indoors. I chose the Kasa camera because I already have the Kasa smart plugs. For about $20 dollars this is a camera with a lot of nice features. It is extremely easy to install and use. First, download the Kasa Smart App and create an account. Second, plug the camera into a power source, open the app add the camera and follow the directions. Once added, use the 3rd party tab to add to your Alexa account and google home account. If you already have added those accounts, then the camera will automatically be added and you can access it through the Alexa and google home app. The camera once added did require a firmware update and this took about 2 minutes. Some helpful tips I learned during my encounter with set up. The EC70 camera will accept a microSD card from 8 to 256GB used for local storage. Even though it tells you during set up to add, you will NOT be able to do so unless the camera is tilted up as high as it can go. So, you may have to finish set up, then start the camera and tilt it up before you can install it. For the Alexa app, the app will NOT turn the EC70 camera on or off. I am able to connect the camera to my Echo Show and FireTV only. The camera WILL send notifications to any Amazon device, and you are able to pick which devices to receive notifications. For google home, it is essentially the same, you need to have a Nest or Chromecast device in order to view the EC70 camera output. You probably will need to use the google help page for instructions on how to set it up. You can set the EC70 camera for different views of the area you wish to see, and can also place it on patrol mode to automatically move to each view. There are a wide range of positions available to meet your particular specifications and needs. The camera is mobile, unless you attach it to a wall or ceiling with the included bracket. The picture quality is great, and you do have options for the video quality settings depending on your wifi. I read other reviews and some of the negativity of the EC70 camera most likely is due to your wifi, not the actual equipment. I have used this camera to watch the front door when I am in the back, and also to watch the dogs. It is nice to receive the notification that they are at the door, so I can let them out to do their business. I am very happy with my purchase. I hope you find this review helpful."

After this time, I have a mostly positive impression, although with some nuances that they should consider.\n\nWhat I like (Pros):\n\n\u00b7 Sharp 2K image: The video quality is excellent for an indoor camera. 2K resolution allows you to see details clearly, even when the image is enlarged. Night vision is equally effective, illuminating the room completely in crisp black and white.\n\n\u00b7 Panoramic movement and excellent inclination: This is, without a doubt, its best feature. The 360\u00b0 movement and tilt are smooth and allow you to virtually cover an entire room without blind spots. It is perfect for following a playful pet or for scanning a large room.\n\n\u00b7 Precise AI motion detection: The \"AI Motion Detection\" function works quite well.

The washer and dryer are located downstairs and they have to guess when the loads are done and usually come storming back upstairs complaining there are still 10 minutes left, etc. Now, they can take a look at the live view with the app and clearly see (and hear!) before even getting off the couch or whatever if it's done or not! No more wasted trips- they love it! The camera has some really neat features also. The live view can be zoomed just like a photo on your phone with your fingers. You can pan the camera up/down and left/right. You can get it set perfectly where you want it and set that as a named position, then on the app you can press those position buttons and it adjusts the camera exactly to that view. If someone else is down there you can talk back and forth with each other. Fortunately, the app also gives you the ability to enable or disable alarms, notices, etc- which is perfect for our scenario where we only want to look at the live view when we want and nothing else! Great buy!"

You can control the camera from your phone and move it around but it also tracks movement by itself. The movement alert I receive on my phone is within seconds of the initial movement. I like that multiple users can access the camera as well from different devices. The talk feature is also a plus."

I also have several Ring cameras, and I noticed that the annual and monthly plan subscriptions are significantly more affordable, making it easier to secure your home/property. I noted a slight lag that may have been due to the wifi service. A feature I wish this camera offered is the ability to keep a view of the live footage on your main screen after exiting the app. Like Ring offers. With this camera, you have to keep the application open on your main screen to monitor activity. The app allows you to receive motion alerts, which are very accurate and driven by sensitivity settings. The camera is efficient and offers mounting options. It is an inexpensive way to protect your home."

I use it mainly for to check in on my pets, and the motion detection alerts work reliably without being overly sensitive.

The feature where the motion detector follows the motion that it sees was better than any other camera I have used before. Also, the responsiveness of the pan tilt was excellent.\n\nThe only thing I would say, and this is very common with many of these cameras, is that the communication of the talk feature back-and-forth could have been a little crisper. My voice from the mobile device back to the camera seemed a little garbled. But again that is very common on all of these cameras."

The directions were simple and set up went smoothly. It only took a few minutes. Picture quality is good and following the motion it senses is right on. You do have to make sure the power cord is plugged entirely into the camera. The only thing I wish is that it had a longer power cord, but that is a personal preference. For the money, you can't go wrong."

This camera was super easy to set up and has all the features I need to check in on my pets when I am sat work or away from home. Picture quality is good and the field of vision adequate, and with the panning feature it is easy to look into different areas of a room. You can pan side to side at least 180 degrees as well as up and down to a certain degree.\n\nThe camera plus into a wall outlet so there is no concern over battery life. I have another security camera that I use in another area of the house that is rechargeable which is great for an area that isn\u2019t close to a power outlet but you always have to worry about battery life and recharging. No concern with this one.\n\nAs with other security camera you can set up alerts for motion and it has other features. One feature I like is being able to use a SD card to store pictures and videos rather than use a cloud account although you still have that option for a price. Picture quality is good, the only issue I\u2019ve experienced is when the camera is pointed to a window which makes the picture much darker trying to adjust to the bright light.

        "text": "I was looking for a second cat camera to monitor our cats when we\u2019re away from home, with specific needs: two-way audio, local and cloud recording, motion detection with alerts, and clear video with night vision. The TP-Link Tapo Pan/Tilt Security Camera, on sale for just $19, checked all my boxes and exceeded expectations with some unexpected bonuses. Here\u2019s my experience to help you decide if this camera is right for you.\n\nPerformance and Features\n\nThe 1080P video is sharp and clear, providing enough detail to see what my cats are up to, even in low light thanks to the reliable night vision. The pan/tilt feature allows me to cover a wide area of the room, and the motion detection works flawlessly, sending alerts to my phone and triggering house lights when set up. The two-way audio is a fun bonus\u2014I tested it and startled my cats by speaking through the camera when I wasn\u2019t in the room! My wife loves that we can share video clips easily through the app, which adds a nice touch for capturing cute moments.\n\nSetup and Integration\n\nSetup was a breeze, and I was thrilled to find that the Tapo app automatically integrated with my existing Kasa app, adding the camera to my master device list without any extra effort. It works seamlessly with both Alexa and Google Home, allowing voice commands and linking motion alerts to control smart lights in the house. I inserted a 128GB Class 10 micro-SD card for local recording, which provides up to 16 days of continuous storage, and I also set up cloud recording for added peace of mind. Both recording options work perfectly for my needs.\n\nVerdict\n\nAt $19, this camera is an absolute steal for a pet or baby monitor. It delivers clear video, reliable motion detection, two-way audio, and night vision, with the added flexibility of local and cloud storage. The seamless integration with the Kasa app, Alexa, and Google Home makes it incredibly user-friendly, and the ability to share clips is a fun perk. Whether you\u2019re keeping an eye on pets, kids, or your home, this camera offers premium features at a budget-friendly price. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a versatile, high-quality security camera.\n\nPro Tip: Pair it with a high-capacity micro-SD card (like a 128GB Class 10) for extended local recording, and take advantage of the Alexa/Google Home integration to link motion alerts with smart home devices for added convenience. If you find this useful please mark as Helpful!"

        "text": "I returned this after one day. Initial setup took about 25 minutes, not bad. And for a day, it worked fine: good camera quality, decent Android app, appropriate alert messages. But the second day, the app lost its network connection, and could not be fixed with 30 minutes of troubleshooting. Worse, the app caused my phone to claim that its wifi connection had no internet. (The wifi was fine--I confirmed via my laptop that the wifi network had a working internet connection). Rebooting and restarting the app and the phone multiple times did not fix the problem. There is zero manufacturer documentation on how to troubleshoot this. The only document available online simply indicates the names of the buttons, and says to \"make sure your network settings are correct,\" without detailing in any way what those correct settings might be. After poring over the comments on Amazon and other sites, I learned that repeatedly losing network connectivity is common, and you can try fixing it by calling your internet provider and/or the manufacturer and/or tweaking a bunch of advanced network-related settings, but I don't have the time, energy or bandwidth for that. So I returned it. Fortunately, after uninstalling the app from my phone, my phone once again had a working internet connection via the wifi network.\nI'm now considering simpler technologies to monitor my 102-year-old mother: either a no-wifi baby monitor, or a simple motion detector alarm. Ironically, both of these less-complex items cost more than twice as much as this high-tech camera, but I figure it'll be worth it in headaches and aggravation saved. (Note: in my day, I worked as a programmer, so I am reasonably adept at these things. But the older I get, the less patience I have for things that don't work out of the box).\nBottom line: if you're tech-savvy and/or enjoy long calls with customer service and have plenty of time to troubleshoot, this is a great camera monitor. Really, it does a lot for the price, and does it well. When it works."

Setup was straightforward with the Tapo app, and the camera synced to WiFi in under two minutes. The pan and tilt movement is much smoother than expected at this price, and I really like that it doesn\u2019t overshoot when adjusting angles.\n\nVideo quality is solid with clear detail in both daylight and room-light conditions. The biggest surprise was the night vision. The infrared mode produces a sharp image where facial features and objects are actually recognizable instead of foggy blobs. Motion detection works well and sends timely alerts, though I reduced sensitivity to avoid notifications every time my pet moved.\n\nTwo-way audio is clean enough for quick check-ins. The speaker isn\u2019t loud, but it\u2019s clear. I tested both cloud storage and an SD card; the SD card option is the better long-term value.\n\nOverall, this is a very dependable indoor camera with smooth controls and better clarity than I expected at this price.

        "text": "Tapo Camera/Monitoring System\n\nCertainly a fairly economical video monitoring system. We made 2 purchases initially then added another a few weeks later and 1 more for a total of 4 covering 4 different areas/rooms. 3x was 1080HD and 1x was 2k version. It\u2019s been a few months of daily usage and monitoring, for the most part they have been quite beneficial but not without some shortcomings. Below are some pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n\nVideo: High enough quality for 1080HD, the 2k version does add a bit of extra clarity but at a distance greater than 25 feet it\u2019s only slightly noticeable.\n\nPan/Tilt: It\u2019s a pretty nice feature to have, although a bit of a limitation for the tilt part when it\u2019s standing upright; when it\u2019s mounted on say the ceiling, it offers better range for the tilt.\n\nMotion Detection & Tracking: both are nice features to have to trigger the camera, the tracking appears to do a good job in following the movements.\n\nCloud or physical SD card storage: good to have both options available but given our needs a few 128GB and 256GB SD cards worked\n\nModes: day mode, night mode and auto mode settings can be easily toggled depending on the time of day and lighting for better video clarity. In addition, the camera has a built in night vision to aid in video capture during dim lighting.\n\nAudio: is sufficient and clear enough during recording and live 2-way\n\nEcosystem: Tapo ecosystem/app isn\u2019t too bad, since we have multiple cameras it\u2019s one Tapo app and all the videos/cameras can be streamed/stored in 1 app and displayed 1 screen at a time or split screens in 2s,3s,4s etc.\n\nCONS:\n\nOne of the features that can be improved is the 2 minute pause. During this time, a note will be prompted \u201cyou have viewed the live video for 2 minutes without any operation. continue the viewing? \u201c. We find this feature to be a bit of a nuisance especially if one is looking for a continual visual feed.\n\nVideo capture: the camera appears to have a sleep mode so there may be a bit of a delay before recording begins, thus sometimes some footages aren\u2019t fully captured, sometimes a few seconds are noticeably missing if not longer; at times we also notice with distances greater than 25 feet, footages aren\u2019t always captured or only partially captured.\n\nIt\u2019s probably not the cameras fault but if there a bit of a weaker WiFi signal,\nInterference or dead spot then the monitoring system may not sync with the Tapo camera so no video can be seen. We find the kitchen area next to all the appliances may be causing some interference. During this temporary \u201coutage\u201d the (camera) recording seems to be working just not able to view/monitor. Troubleshooting is as simple as getting closer to the camera with the mobile device, restarting the app or WiFi or restarting the Tapo camera by pulling and replugging it."

This new ONVIF/RTSP camera does not compare to the quality or functionality of the older PTZ cameras which had many options and were easy to view/manage in just about any IP Camera viewer app.\n\nFor starters, there is no way you can use this camera without installing the Tapo app. Why must you eat up your precious phone memory by installiing a NEW app for every piece of hardware you want to access remotely? Well folks, that seems to be the Brave New World of proprietary products and self-centered corporations manufacturing the products we need.\n\nThis camera has no setup where you can browse into the camera and change all the settings.\nCan you assign a static IP? NOPE.\nCan you assign a custom camera port #? NOPE\nCan you assign preset positions? NOPE\nCan you use an http browser to connect to the camera, adjust settings, and view streaming video? NOPE, NOPE, and NOPE\n\nThe mounting options are cheap. In the past you were given a bracket that allowed you to adjust in the vertical and hoizontal planes. This comes with the cheapest mounting bracket that would be possible for the human brain to conceive.\n\nIs horizontal adjustment possible? NOPE\nIs vertical adjustment possible? NOPE\n\nYou essentially stick this on any horizonal or surface the way you want it with no possibility to fine turn where the camera is pointing, via bracket. You must \"hope\" that the PTZ movement of the camera is able to point it where you want to view. If not, then you're either SOL or you must purchase a camera mounting bracket to give you the movements that should have been included as standard.\n\nGiven all I say above, you might be surprised to know that my opinion this camera is that it's not a bad camera and could be consideered better than average, considering the competition.\n\nYes, many would consider this crappo and I'd have to include myself in that crowd, but if you consider the limitations vs. price, then this camera becomes a little less crappo because its' limations can be managed, especially when you consider that all the newer ONVIF/RTSP cameras that I've investigated, many at a MUCH higher price, has the same or worse defects than this camera.\n\nSo, what were considering is what is the LEAST Crappy camera available?\n\nBelieve or not, folks, this is probably the Least Crappy camera out there.\n\nYour system prerequisite if you want to use a non-Tapo view app to view/operat this camera is that you need to setup Port forwardings of 2020 (internal) and 554 (internal) to the IP Address for EACH C200 camera on your network. Your router must be able to make IP Reservatons for DHCP for the IP of this camera. If not, your IP will keep changing and you'll continually lose remote access to this camera because setting a statis IP Address in camera setup is impossible. But, if you can setup and IP Reservation on your router and can port forward for EACH camera to 2020 and 554 to each camera then you're likely okay with this camera.\n\nOnce this is done, you might be able to view this camera on 3rd party IP Camera viewer app that support ONFIV/RTSP.\n\nBecause TAPO is an Alexa skill, it's pretty easy to view this camera on any Alexa Echo SHOW device. I setup a routine (Named for my cat) that will cause Alexa echo Show to view a fixed position stream of my camera. You CANNOT move the camera using Alexa echo Show, but you can view the camera stream from where it's positioned right now.\n\nThe Tapo cloud service is worthless, but if you add a 128gb micro SD card, then you can save detected motion to know what's happening when something moves in front of the camera to trigger recoding. This works pretty well and gives you several minutes of recording time. You cannot just click and download these clips, which is idiotic. But, if you play the clip, then click \"Record\" you can record the playing clip, then download this recording. It's convoluted, but better than removing the SD card, placing into PC, and copying over the clip(s).\n\nI definitely am not in LOVE with this camera, and if a REAL camera came along that would allow me to view on Alexa echo Show, browse into configure all aspects of the camera, and use on any 3rd party remote view app, then I'd jump ship in a second and buy THAT camera.\n\nBut... given that ALL these type cameras SUCK, I woudl choose THIS camera because it sucks at a LOWER price. So, if your camera sucks, it's better to pay less for a sucky camera, if you can.\n\nRight now with the state of suck in IP Cameras, I'd recommend this camera as a BUY. I don't like it much, but it's better than whatever else you might be able to buy at a reasonable price.\n\nJust like when voting for political candidates, sometimes you just have to go with the one that sucks less out of a field of choices that all suck.\n\nGood Luck!!"

That was a bad experience. Although I was able to view cameras, all of the functions like pan and rift were very erratic. After 1 week, one of three cameras lost configuration and would not work.\n\nI replaced my BluRams because they did not have capabilities of recording locally, these Tp-Link did, via SD card that user furnishes. I am not impressed. My mesh routers work great, but these cameras do no. The PTZ control is crap.."

It offers 1080p video quality, pan and tilt functionality for a wide field of view, two-way audio, night vision, and both cloud and SD card storage options.\n\nClear Video Quality: The camera delivers crisp 1080p video, allowing users to see details clearly, whether monitoring a baby or a pet.\n\nPan and Tilt: The pan and tilt functionality (360\u00b0 horizontal and 114\u00b0 vertical) provides a wide view of the room, eliminating blind spots.\n\nMotion Detection and Notifications: The camera detects motion and sends instant notifications to the user's smartphone. This feature can be customized to trigger alerts for specific events, like baby crying.\n\nTwo-Way Audio: The built-in microphone and speaker allow for two-way communication, enabling users to interact with their pets or soothe a baby.\nNight Vision:\nThe camera's infrared night vision allows for clear visibility even in low-light conditions, extending its usability to nighttime monitoring.\nStorage Options:\nUsers can choose between cloud storage (with Tapo Care subscription) or local storage on a microSD card.\n\nIntegration with Smart Home Systems: The camera works with Alexa and Google Assistant, allowing for voice control and integration with other smart home devices.\n\nPrivacy Mode: A privacy mode allows users to disable the camera's monitoring functionality when needed.\n\nPotential Drawbacks: Some users have reported occasional delays in loading the live view, and motion blur can occur in some instances, according to a review on SafeWise.\n\nOverall: The TP-Link Tapo C200 is a well-regarded option for a versatile indoor security camera, particularly for those seeking a baby monitor or pet camera with a good balance of features and price."
